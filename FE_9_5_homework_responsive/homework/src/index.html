            <h3>The dark side of the moon is myth.</h3>
            <p>In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight
                however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is
                because the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the same
                time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facing
                the Earth. The side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the
                human eye from spacecraft.

            <h3>The rise and fall of the tides on Earth is caused by the Moon.</h3>
            <p>There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational pull that
                the Moon exerts; one on the side facing the Moon, and the other on
                the opposite side that faces away from the Moon, The bulges move
                around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides
                around the globe.

            <h3>The Moon is drifting away from the Earth.</h3>
            <p>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet
                every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for around 50
                billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be taking around
                47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.

            <h3>A person would weigh much less on the Moon.</h3>
            <p>The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller
                mass, so you would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of your weight on
                Earth. This is why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound so high
                in the air.

            <h3>The Moon has only been walked on by 12 people; all American males.</h3>
            <p>The first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969 was Neil Armstrong
                on the Apollo 11 mission, while the last man to walk on the Moon in
                1972 was Gene Cernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Since then the
                Moon has only be visited by unmanned vehicles.

            <h3>The Moon has no atmosphere.</h3>
            <p>This means that the surface of the Moon is unprotected from
                cosmic rays, meteorites and solar winds, and has huge temperature
                variations. The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard on
                the Moon, and the sky always appears black.

            <h3>The Moon has quakes.</h3>
            <p>These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar
                astronauts used seismographs on their visits to the Moon, and found
                that small moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath the
                surface, causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a
                molten core, just like Earth.

                passed within 5995 km of the surface of the Moon before going into
                orbit around the Sun.

            <p>NASA plans to return astronauts to the moon to set up a permanent
                space station. Mankind may once again walk on the moon in 2019, if
