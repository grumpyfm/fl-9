    <p>Some people shy away from travelling alone, a few embrace it. So, what is it that makes it an <b>attractive
        option</b>? What are the advantages of going it
        alone?
    </p>

    <p> Well first things first, travelling solo can be very liberating. The itinerary you set and all the decisions you
        make are yours and yours alone.
        You don't need to worry about any other person or group. In other words, there's no need to compromise, there
        are no arguments, and no need to
        second-guess what other people want or need.

    <p>Travelling alone is also a great confidence builder. Yes, at times it can feel a bit lonely, but that is just one
        of many problems you
        will have to solve yourself, along with making your own arrangements, and setting your own goals.Have you
        noticed that when you’re on your own,
        people are more willing to start a conversation with you?
    </p>

    <p>You're more likely to take the initiative as well, and before you know it, up pops an invitation for a meal, a
        side trip, a stay at
        someone’s home. For some odd reason people keep a slight distance from couples and groups, probably because they
        seem so self-contained and exclusive.

    <p class="even">Thomas Jefferson once said: “One travels more usefully when alone because he reflects more,” and
        it’s true: you have much more time
        to contemplate things. A day long visit to one museum? No problem. A long hike on a trail frought with danger?
